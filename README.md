# CSCI 2020 Final Project Group 12

## About the Project
Our project goal is a chat client with the ability to export logs as .txt.
To do this we used many of the tools that we learned about through the labs for this course.

## Contributions
* Kushal Parmar

 	* Created the base framework for the project
 	* Worked with sockets to send messages between a client and server
* Robert Marshall
	* Expanded upon the UI
	* Added ability to export chat logs from the server side
	* Added a listener for the ENTER key to send messages

## Instructions to use
You should be able to run the gradle file and the program should run.

If this fails, opening the server and client java files in an IDE and building them should work.

To be safe make sure the server opens before the client so the client has something to connect to.
